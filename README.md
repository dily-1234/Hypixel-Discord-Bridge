# Hypixel-Discord-Bridge

This is a Hypixel and Discord Bridge Bot which allows chats from discord to be shown in guild chat on Hypixel.

This bot was made in Discord version 13. Ill try to update the bot in the future to version 14 of discord.

## How to begin

I will assume you have nodejs installed

1. Go into the config.json folder and enter all the necessary fields for the bot
2. Do `npm install` this will install all the node_modules
3. To start the bot enter `node bot.js` this will start the bot and your user will login to Hypixel.
